TopologyOptimization
====================

A simple Topology Optimization (based on the 99-line Matlab code by Ole Sigmund).

The implementation contains a simple banded matrix and a full matrix class (not used).

The matrix class depends on the BLAS library.

Currently the code has only been tested under OS/X, but should run on Linux and Windows with only a few modifications.
